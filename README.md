# Delta's Performance and Operational Analysis on Tableau
This is a comprehensive Tableau-based project aimed at analyzing and presenting Delta Airlines' performance metrics in comparison to its key competitors in the aviation industry. This data-driven analysis focuses on various performance indicators (KPIs) , including operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, financial health, and market share. The Dataset is a Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Datset from May 2022 to April 2023.






OUTCOMES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO DELTA AIRLINES BASED ON OUR DATASET: 

From the set of visualizations we've created, some of the insights that we have gained that can be used to iprove the business are as follows 
1. Delta can improve the no.of flights during their off season period that could improve their business and in turn strive to compete with South west airlines as well as become way better that American Airlines

2. Delta has their hub in Georgia, Atlanta. This marks to be an area that is offset from the geogrphical center of United States of America. This therefore makes it difficult to reach destinations that are far West. Having a hub that is at the center of the of the States can indeed improve their ability to reach destinations easier and faster.

3. Delta Airlines should focus more on decreasing the Air Time compared to the distance travelled. That is no. of miles travelled  should be maximum for the specific time taken.

4. Although the delay percentage for Delta is far better than its competitors it still is a higher number. If we consider Southwest to be the ultimate benchmark then this aspect of the airline performance must definitely be considered for improvement.
